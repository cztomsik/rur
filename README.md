# rur
Simple, yet useful client-side router.

The only reason this exists is that I couldn't find any framework-agnostic, two-way router (able to get url for given route & params) with small footprint. The only option was (is?) [router.js](https://github.com/tildeio/router.js/) by [ember.js](https://emberjs.com) team which is:

  - independent but influenced by ember
  - too flexible
  - requires another library (almost 50 KB in total)
